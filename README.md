# vaccination-is-good

The system should support following features:
● Support multiple vaccination centres in Singapore
● Keep into account the daily supply of the nurses for each centre and their duty schedule
● Model the daily capacity of a centre and accordingly allocate the vaccination slots to
the residents
● Support CRUD operations for the slot reservation
● Avoid double reservation (What happens if the same user books again?)
● The solution should handle the resource contention (What happens if 2 different users
book the same time slot?)
